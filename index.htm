<h2 id="about-">about ✨<a class="anchorjs-link " href="#about-" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>A robotics engineer and artist based in San Francisco, California. I 
enjoy innovating and creating, building autonomous systems, and solving 
highly complex technical problems. Since I was a kid, I’ve also been 
drawn to the world of creative arts, like painting and writing. You can 
find my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/morii.gallery/">artwork here</a> and my <a href="https://moorissa.medium.com/">blog here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="currently-">currently 🦾<a class="anchorjs-link " href="#currently-" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>I work as a senior systems engineer at <a href="https://www.getcruise.com/">Cruise</a>,
 a robotaxi startup currently developing an L4 autonomy, where I 
specialize in perception and have developed a broad range of experience 
within the simulation and autonomy stacks. My interests lie in pushing 
the boundaries of AI and robotics towards achieving the world’s first L5
 technology, as I believe it represents a fundamental shift towards a 
much safer and more sustainable earth for all.</p>

<p>I was previously at <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a> for nearly 4 years, where I helped the Autopilot team launch its first <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot">Full Self-Driving (FSD)</a> feature. Prior to that, I worked as a machine learning researcher at <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/">NASA Goddard Institute</a> on <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelE/">climate change models</a> and the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a> on supply chain optimizations for <a href="https://www.wfp.org/specialized-nutritious-food">reducing malnutritions</a> in Subsaharan Africa.</p>

<h2 id="engineering-">engineering 🚀<a class="anchorjs-link " href="#engineering-" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>I completed an M.S. in Data Science with a focus on Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, and at 19, a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a minor in Statistics (summa cum laude) from <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>.
 During sophomore year, I fell in love with statistical learning theory 
taught by Dr. Nicoleta Serban and subsequently took a PhD engineering 
course in that domain.</p>

<p>My fascination towards robotics and embodied artificial intelligence 
didn’t actually develop until Tesla, when I started working on firmware 
UI, closed-loop simulations, and algorithmic state machines with some of
 the strongest engineers I’d worked with. Maybe they’re right when they 
say curiosity killed the cat–naiveté too actually–but satisfaction 
somehow always brought it back to life. So there goes my top rule for a 
fulfilling life: <em>Follow your curiosity</em> :).</p>

<p>In the past few years, I’ve enjoyed sharing my experiences and 
knowledge on AI/robotics at various types of institutions, including 
universities, private and public institutions, and government 
ministries. If you are interested in collaborating for an event, let’s

<p>When I’m not creating, I love learning about cultures and 
philosophies around the world–whether through local communities, 
volunteering, or living abroad temporarily. I’ve gone to 29 countries so
 far, and was lucky enough to live in France, Brazil, and South Africa 
for a couple months. I truly enjoy learning about different cultures and
 connecting with so many of you from all corners of the globe.</p>

<p>So, please connect with me! I speak English, Indonesian, Javanese, 
and not enough French, but highly proficient in Google Translate and 
ChatGPT. Feel free to write me a note via <a href="mailto:moorissa.maura@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moorissa/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for being part of my journey, keep slaying!</p>

<p>M.</p>
